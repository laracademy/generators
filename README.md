**Laracademy Generators** - is a tool set that helps speed up the development process of a Laravel application.

**Author(s):**
* [Laracademy](https://laracademy.co) ([@laracademy](http://twitter.com/laracademy), michael@laracademy.co)

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.6+
2. Laravel 6.*
3. MySQL *

** For Laravel 5.* please use the version 1.5

## Usage

### Step 1: Install through Composer

```
composer require "laracademy/generators" --dev
```

### Step 2: Artisan Command
Now that we have added the generator to our project the last thing to do is run Laravel's Arisan command

```
php artisan
```

You will see the following in the list

```
generate:modelfromtable
```

## Commands

### generate:modelfromtable

This command will read your database table and generate a model based on that table structure. The fillable fields, casts, dates and even namespacing will be filled in automatically.

You can use this command to generate a single table, multiple tables or all of your tables at once.

This command comes with a bunch of different options, please see below for each parameter

* --table=
  * This parameter if filled in will generate a model for the given table
  * You can also pass in a list of tables using comma separated values
* --all=[_true|false (default)_]
  * If this flag is present, then the table command will be ignored
  * This will generate a model for **all** tables found in your database
  * You can optionally specify a whitelist/blacklist in `config/modelfromtable.php`
  * _Note: by default, this command will only ignore the `migrations` table_
* --connection=
  * By default, if omitted, the default connection found in `config/database.php` will be used
  * To specify a connection, first ensure that it exists in your `config/database.php`
* --folder=
  * By default, all models are store in your _app/_ directory. If you wish to store them in another place you can provide the relative path from your base laravel application.
  * Alternatively, use a lambda in `config/modelfromtable.php` to dynamically specify folder path
* --namespace=
  * By default, all models will have the namespace of `App\Models`
  * Alternatively, use a lambda in `config/modelfromtable.php` to dynamically specify namespace
* --debug=[_true|false (default)_]
  * Shows some more information while running
* --singular=[_true|false (default)_]
  * This will create a singular titled model, e.g. "Categories" -> "Category"
* --overwrite=[_true|false (default)_]
  * Overwrite model file(s) if exists
* --timestamps=[_true|false (default)_]
  * whether to timestamp or not

## Examples (CLI)

### Generating a single table

```
php artisan generate:modelfromtable --table=users
```

### Generating a multiple tables

```
php artisan generate:modelfromtable --table=users,posts
```

### Generating all tables

```
php artisan generate:modelfromtable --all=true
```

### Changing to another connection found in `database.php` and generating models for all tables

```
php artisan generate:modelfromtable --connection=spark --all=true
```

### Changing the folder where to /app/Models

```
php artisan generate:modelfromtable --table=user --folder=app\Models
```

## Configuration file for saving defaults, dynamic lambdas
A [config file](https://github.com/laracademy/generators/blob/master/config/modelfromtable.php) should be in your project's config folder (if not, you can easily create it). Through this, you can set defaults you commonly use to cut down on the input your command line call requires. For example: `'all' => true`. Then when you run `php artisan generate:modelfromtable` all tables will be generated by default. Some fields, like `namespace`, accept a static value or, more powerfully, a lambda to generate dynamic values. Additional fields not available to the CLI are available in the config. See below.

### Primary Key, using lamba (config only)
Some apps do not use the Laravel default of `id`, so say your table name prefixes the primary key...
```php
'primaryKey' => fn(string $tableName) => "{$tableName}_id",
```
Some legacy databases do not conform to a standard, so a more powerful example could be querying the primary key column directly...
```php
'primaryKey' => (function (string $tableName) {
    $primaryKey = collect(DB::select(DB::raw("SHOW KEYS FROM {$tableName} WHERE Key_name = 'PRIMARY'")))->first();
    return ($primaryKey) ? $primaryKey->Column_name : false;
}),
```

### Whitelist/Blacklist (config only)
Particularly large databases often have a number of tables that aren't meant to have models. These can easily be filtered through either the whitelist or blacklist (or both!). Laravel's "migrations" table is already included in the blacklist. One nice feature is that you can wildcard table names if that makes sense for your situation...
```php
'blacklist' => ['migrations'];
'whitelist' => ['user_address', 'system_*'];
```

### Filename, using lambda
Large databases sometimes use a pattern of prefixing for organization, which you can use to organize your model files through a lambda.
```php
'filename' => fn(string $tableName) => Str::studly(Str::after($tableName, '_')),
```
In this example, 'system_user' would generate the filename 'User'.
_Note that this is also available through the CLI, but it probably doesn't make as much sense to set there._

### Folder path, using lambda
Using the last example, you can also organize the folder path using the prefix...
```php
'folder' => (function (string $tableName) {
    $prefix = Str::studly(Str::before($tableName, '_'));
    $path = app()->path('Models') . "/{$prefix}";

    if (!is_dir($path)) {
        mkdir($path);
    }

    return $path;
}),
```
In this example, 'system_user' would generate the folder path 'path/to/your/install/app/Models/System'

### Namespace, using lambda
Using the last example, you would want to then generate a matching namespace to the file path
```php
'namespace' => fn(string $folderpath) => 'App/Models' . Str::after($folderpath, app()->path('Models')),
```
Therefore the folder path 'path/to/your/install/app/Models/System' would generate the namespace 'App\Models\System'

### Delimiter (config only)
By default array values are delimited with a simple comma, but a common preference is to delimit with a newline as well.
```php
'delimiter' => ",\n" . str_repeat(' ', 8),
```
Result:
```php
class SomeModel extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'SomeField',
        'AnotherField',
        'YetAnotherField'
    ];
```
